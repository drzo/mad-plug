# Vorticog

Vorticog (package name: virtunomics) is a full-stack agentic business simulation game engine combining business management (companies, units, production, markets, finance) with AI-driven semi-autonomous agents, DreamCog narrative storytelling, and SimsFreePlay-inspired life simulation systems. Built on the Manus WebDev scaffold (web-db-user).

**Repositories**: `ReZorg/vorticog` (main app, forked from `o9nn/vorticog`) + `o9nn/simsfreeplay-ext` (Python simulation library)

## Architecture Overview

The system has four interconnected layers:

**Business Simulation**: Companies own business units (office, store, factory, mine, farm, laboratory) in cities. Units have employees, inventory, and production queues. Resources flow through production recipes. A market system enables trading between companies. Financial transactions and a technology research tree drive progression.

**Agentic Simulation**: Semi-autonomous agents (customer, supplier, employee, partner, investor, competitor) have personas with motivational levels, emotional states (happiness, satisfaction, stress, loyalty, trust), needs (financial, security, recognition, autonomy, social), and character traits. Agents form relationships, join groups and communities, and participate in events that cascade emotional and relationship impacts.

**DreamCog Integration**: Extends agents with Big Five personality (OCEAN), communication style attributes, behavioral tendencies, motivations (short/long-term goals, core values), and memories (with emotional impact and importance). Adds world-building: worlds with genre/rules, hierarchical locations, lore entries, historical timeline events, and scheduled future events with condition-based triggers. **Narrative generation is powered by the Erebus 350M local sidecar engine**, which translates agent states and events into rich, genre-tagged prose.

**SimsFreePlay Simulation Engine** (`o9nn/simsfreeplay-ext`): A Python library providing the behavioral engine for agent autonomy. Four subsystems: NeedsSystem (6 decaying needs: hunger, energy, hygiene, social, fun, bladder), ActionQueue (priority queue with 10 action templates producing need/skill/relationship effects), RelationshipSystem (friendship -100 to +100, romance 0-100, 16 interaction types, threshold-based type progression from stranger to spouse), and SkillSystem (15 skills across 5 categories, level 0-10 with XP scaling). The Agent class wires these together with callback chains: action completion fulfills needs and grants skill XP, critical needs auto-queue urgent actions, and an AgentManager handles population-level batch updates.

## Development Workflow

### Clone and Setup

```bash
gh repo clone ReZorg/vorticog
cd vorticog
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env   # Configure DATABASE_URL and API keys
npm run db:push         # Apply migrations
npm run dev             # Start dev server at http://localhost:5000
```

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Schema**: Define tables in `drizzle/schema.ts` with Drizzle ORM. Add relations. Export Select and Insert types.
2. **Database functions**: Add CRUD functions in `server/db.ts`. Import schema types.
3. **API routes**: Add tRPC router in `server/routers.ts`. Use `protectedProcedure` for auth-required endpoints. Validate input with Zod.
4. **Frontend**: Add page in `client/src/pages/`. Register route in `App.tsx`. Use tRPC hooks from `@/lib/trpc`.
5. **Tests**: Add test file in `server/`. Run `npm run test`.
6. **Migrate**: Run `npm run db:push` to generate and apply migrations.

### Key Files to Modify

| Task | File(s) |
|---|---|
| Add/modify tables | `drizzle/schema.ts` |
| Add database functions | `server/db.ts` |
| Add API endpoints | `server/routers.ts` |
| Add pages/routes | `client/src/pages/`, `client/src/App.tsx` |
| Add UI components | `client/src/components/` |
| Configure environment | `server/_core/env.ts`, `.env` |
| Use LLM | `server/_core/llm.ts` → `invokeLLM()` (structured), `server/erebus.ts` → `invokeErebus()` (narrative) |
| Use storage | `server/storage.ts` → `storagePut()`, `storageGet()` |

### Agent Creation Pattern

Create a fully-modeled agent in this order:

```typescript
// 1. Create base agent
const agent = await trpc.agent.create.mutate({
  type: "employee", name: "Elena", personaId: 1, cityId: 1, companyId: myCompanyId
});
// 2. Add Big Five personality
await trpc.personality.create.mutate({
  agentId: agent.id, openness: 85, conscientiousness: 70,
  extraversion: 45, agreeableness: 80, neuroticism: 35, leadership: 75, empathy: 85
});
// 3. Add traits
await trpc.agent.addTrait.mutate({agentId: agent.id, traitId: 1, intensity: 80});
// 4. Add motivations
await trpc.motivation.create.mutate({
  agentId: agent.id, motivationType: "long_term",
  description: "Become CTO", priority: 9
});
// 5. Record initial memories
await trpc.memory.create.mutate({
  agentId: agent.id, memoryType: "achievement",
  content: "Hired as lead engineer", importance: 7, memoryDate: new Date()
});
```

### Event Processing Pattern

```typescript
// Create event with impacts
const event = await trpc.event.create.mutate({
  type: "negotiation", initiatorAgentId: 1, targetAgentId: 2,
  title: "Contract Negotiation", scheduledAt: new Date(),
  emotionalImpact: {satisfaction: 5, stress: 10},
  relationshipImpact: {agentIds: [1, 2], strengthChange: 10, positivityChange: 5}
});
// Process when ready — applies impacts, creates history snapshots
await trpc.event.process.mutate({eventId: event.id});
```

## Current Status

Implemented and tested: core business simulation (companies, units, production, markets, finance, leaderboard), full agentic simulation (agents, personas, traits, relationships, groups, communities, events, triggers, history), and DreamCog integration (Big Five personality, motivations, memories, relationship events, worlds, locations, lore, world events, scheduled events).

Not yet implemented: supply chain logistics, quality control, technology research tree UI, contract system, game turn processing loop, and agent decision-making AI. The SimsFreePlay simulation engine (Python) provides the behavioral patterns for the unimplemented game turn loop and agent decision AI — needs decay, autonomous action selection, and population-level batch updates.

## Important Notes

- The `server/_core/` directory is the Manus WebDev scaffold framework layer. Avoid modifying unless extending core capabilities.
- Relationships store `agent1Id < agent2Id` (lower ID first) to prevent duplicates.
- All agent emotional values are 0-100. Event impacts are additive and should be clamped.
- The system uses a dual-LLM architecture: `gemini-2.5-flash` (32k context) for structured reasoning/JSON, and a local `OPT-350M-Erebus` sidecar (2048 context) for creative narrative generation.
- Import shared types from `@shared/types` (re-exports from `drizzle/schema.ts`).
- The SimsFreePlay simulation library (`o9nn/simsfreeplay-ext`) is a Python package. To integrate, either port subsystems to TypeScript (recommended for type safety) or run as a sidecar service.
